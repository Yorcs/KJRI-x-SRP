# Consulate General of Indonesia - Self Reporting Process Application

## Overview

Tools: Flutter | Dart | Firebase

This mobile application is designed to simplify the self-reporting procedure for Indonesian citizens residing abroad, with a current focus on those living in Vancouver, BC. The Self-Reporting Process application aims to minimize user input errors, thereby enabling the consulate team to allocate their manpower more efficiently.


This application is created using Dart and Flutter. Furthermore, it is set to release in Google Play Store for Android users. 


Currently, we are facing a challenge in passing file picker data to the database. Integration of Shared Preferences and the file picker presents a barrier, preventing data transmission through the Shared Preferences function. Our immediate goal is to resolve this issue and establish a direct connection to the database. Additionally, we aspire to launch the application on the Apple Store. Another objective is to enhance scalability across various devices. Initially designed for mobile phones, we aim to extend compatibility to tablets and computers.
